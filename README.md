## üöÄ Getting Started

Once you have installed Talos on your nodes, there are six stages to getting this Flux-managed cluster up and running.

> [!NOTE]
> For all stages below the commands **MUST** be ran on your personal workstation within your repository directory

### üå± Stage 1: Setup your local workstation

1. Install the most recent version of [direnv](https://direnv.net/) and [nix](https://nixos.org).

2. Run this command to allow `direnv` to hook into your shell.

    ```sh
    task workstation:direnv
    ```

### ‚õµ Stage 2: Install Kubernetes

1. Deploy your cluster and bootstrap it. This generates secrets, generates the config files for your nodes and applies them. It bootstraps the cluster afterwards, fetches the kubeconfig file and installs Cilium and kubelet-csr-approver. It finishes with some health checks.

    ```sh
    task bootstrap:talos
    ```

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è It might take a while for the cluster to be setup (10+ minutes is normal), during which time you will see a variety of error messages like: "couldn't get current server API group list," "error: no matching resources found", etc. This is a normal. If this step gets interrupted, e.g. by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>, you likely will need to [nuke the cluster](#-Nuke) before trying again.

#### Cluster validation

1. The `kubeconfig` for interacting with your cluster should have been created in the root of your repository.

2. Verify the nodes are online

    üìç _If this command **fails** you likely haven't configured `direnv` as [mentioned previously](#non-devcontainer-method) in the guide._

    ```sh
    kubectl get nodes -o wide
    # NAME           STATUS   ROLES                       AGE     VERSION
    # k8s-0          Ready    control-plane,etcd,master   1h      v1.30.1
    # k8s-1          Ready    worker                      1h      v1.30.1
    ```

3. Continue on to üîπ [**Stage 6**](#-stage-6-install-flux-in-your-cluster)

### üîπ Stage 3: Install Flux in your cluster

1. Verify Flux can be installed

    ```sh
    flux check --pre
    # ‚ñ∫ checking prerequisites
    # ‚úî kubectl 1.30.1 >=1.18.0-0
    # ‚úî Kubernetes 1.30.1 >=1.16.0-0
    # ‚úî prerequisites checks passed
    ```

2. Install Flux and sync the cluster to the Git repository

    ```sh
    task bootstrap:flux
    # namespace/flux-system configured
    # customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/alerts.notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io created
    # ...
    ```

3. Verify Flux components are running in the cluster

    ```sh
    kubectl -n flux-system get pods -o wide
    # NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    # helm-controller-5bbd94c75-89sb4            1/1     Running   0          1h
    # kustomize-controller-7b67b6b77d-nqc67      1/1     Running   0          1h
    # notification-controller-7c46575844-k4bvr   1/1     Running   0          1h
    # source-controller-7d6875bcb4-zqw9f         1/1     Running   0          1h
    ```

## üí• Reset

There might be a situation where you want to destroy your Kubernetes cluster. The following command will reset your nodes back to maintenance mode, append `--force` to completely format your the Talos installation. Either way the nodes should reboot after the command has run.

```sh
task talos:reset # --force
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Talos and Kubernetes Maintenance

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Updating Talos node configuration

üìç _Ensure you have updated `talconfig.yaml` and any patches with your updated configuration._

```sh
# (Re)generate the Talos config
task talos:generate-config
# Apply the config to the node
task talos:apply-config HOSTNAME=? MODE=?
# e.g. task talos:apply-config HOSTNAME=k8s-0 MODE=reboot
```

#### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Updating Talos and Kubernetes versions

üìç _Ensure the `talosVersion` and `kubernetesVersion` in `talhelper.yaml` are up-to-date with the version you wish to upgrade to._

```sh
# Upgrade the whole cluster to a newer Talos version
task talos:upgrade-cluster
# e.g. task talos:upgrade-cluster
```

```sh
# Upgrade node to a newer Talos version
task talos:upgrade-node HOSTNAME=?
# e.g. task talos:upgrade HOSTNAME=k8s-0
```

```sh
# Upgrade cluster to a newer Kubernetes version
task talos:upgrade-k8s
# e.g. task talos:upgrade-k8s
```

## üêõ Debugging

Below is a general guide on trying to debug an issue with an resource or application. For example, if a workload/resource is not showing up or a pod has started but in a `CrashLoopBackOff` or `Pending` state.

1. Start by checking all Flux Kustomizations & Git Repository & OCI Repository and verify they are healthy.

    ```sh
    flux get sources oci -A
    flux get sources git -A
    flux get ks -A
    ```

2. Then check all the Flux Helm Releases and verify they are healthy.

    ```sh
    flux get hr -A
    ```

3. Then check the if the pod is present.

    ```sh
    kubectl -n <namespace> get pods -o wide
    ```

4. Then check the logs of the pod if its there.

    ```sh
    kubectl -n <namespace> logs <pod-name> -f
    # or
    stern -n <namespace> <fuzzy-name>
    ```

5. If a resource exists try to describe it to see what problems it might have.

    ```sh
    kubectl -n <namespace> describe <resource> <name>
    ```

6. Check the namespace events

    ```sh
    kubectl -n <namespace> get events --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp'
    ```

Resolving problems that you have could take some tweaking of your YAML manifests in order to get things working, other times it could be a external factor like permissions on NFS. If you are unable to figure out your problem see the help section below.
